DiscSpan 0.2.2

---------

This tool is geared more towards smaller files such as music and photos 
as it cannot span a single file across multiple discs.  

If you have lots of files in the gigabyte  range, this utility won't be as efficient.

The tool is written in Python and uses growisofs as the burning interface.


Requirements
------------

It is known to work in Fedora 12, 13, RHEL 5.5, but should work on any recent 
Linux system with growisofs, and python 2.5-2.6.  Requires the dbus-python module.


running and installing DiscSpan
----------------

Directories for Hal (hardware abstraction layer), and schilytools (which is now the suite that contains mkisofs).
Set up a venv for discspin:

`python3 -m /path/to/discspin`

Enter the directory, then activate the venv:

`source ./bin/activate`

Then install dependencies via run `pip install -r requirements.txt`

Put discpan.ini in /etc, /usr/local/etc, the same dir as discspan.py, 
or specify with --config=

To split a folder across multiple blu-ray ISOs (dual layer, in this case):

python discspan.py --iso-dir /volume1/backup/discspan --dir "/volume3/Lightroom/Film Backups" --config ./discspan.ini --disc-type bd-r-dual

Definition for the different media types is available in `discspan.ini`.

Burning directly is not yet supported, but you can get close (with dbus_next). Run `dbus_launch`, which will give you two environment variables. Set these.

```
export DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS=unix:path=/opt/tmp/dbus-B6rOXjeoH3,guid=dc6a75978ed47c071b7ab0916829421a
export DBUS_SESSION_BUS_PID=25016
```

Please edit discspan.ini to reflect the speed of your media/device,
as well as the capacity of your media.  I have seen cases where 
media sizes are slightly varied.

Options for disc type are:

```
floppy = 1.44MiB 147456
cdr = 700M 737280000
dvd_r = 4.384G 4707319808
dvd_rw = 4.384G 4707319808
dvd_r_dl = 7.957G 8543666176
dvd_rw_dl = 7.957G 8543666176
dvd_plus_r = 4.378G 4700372992
dvd_plus_rw = 4.378G 4700372992
dvd_plus_r_dl = 7.961G 8547991552
dvd_plus_rw_dl = 7.961G 8547991552
bd-r-single =  23.3G 25018184499
bd-r-dual = 46.6GiB 50036368998
bd-re-single = 23.3GiB 25018184499
bd-re-dual = 46.6GiB 50036368998
bd-xl-triple = 93.1GiB 99965363814
bd-xl-quadruple = 119.2GiB 127990025420
```

Usage: discspan.py [options]

Options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --config=CONFIG_FILE  Location of config file.
  --start-disc=START_DISC
                        Specify disc to start with (in case of failed previous
                        burn)
  --skip-big            Skip files that are too big.
  --test                Performs a test run of the burn.
  --dir=BACKUP_DIR      Directory to backup.
  --volume-name=VOLUME_NAME
                        Name for the volume.
  --size-factor=SIZE_FACTOR
                        Specify size factor for disc capacity, i.e. 1 = 100%
  --iso-dir=ISO_DIR     Redirect iso generation to a directory. Filename will
                        be generated from volume name.
  -v, --verbose         Extended verbosity



If you don't supply a backup dir, you will be prompted.

limitations
-----------

The discspan.ini measurements are defined in gibibyte and mebibyte.

1G is defined as 2^30 bytes.

Lots of media manufactures define their stuff in gigabytes, which is
93% less than a gibibyte.  

That's why the numbmers you see in discspan.ini may look different
than what's labeled on your media.  Feel free to tweak to your 
hearts content.

discspan will not follow symlinks (yet) !

DBUS doesn't detect the capacity of the disc properly so I can't modify
these on the fly.  If someone can give me the capacity in bytes of a Dual Layer
DVD or Blue Ray/HD-DVD, I can add that.

I've guestimated values but if they are wrong, please tweek them and send
me an appropriate update.

Also, this has only been tested on dvd-r and dvd-rw media.




Thank Yous
-----------
Thanks go out to Doc, Richard, Dez, Erin, Jason, Adam for their debugging, code contributions, and ideas!


Thank you to Davyd Madeley and Dieter Verfaillie for their DBUS
code examples!  Without that, I would not have figured out
how to detect the DVD drive :).

Also thanks to the #python channel on freenode.  Wonderful folks.
